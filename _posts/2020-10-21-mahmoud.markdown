The [**Mahmoud Darwish Foundation and Museum**](http://mahmouddarwish.ps/en) was built 
to commemorate [Mahmoud Darwish](http://mahmouddarwish.ps/en/article/80000160/Mahmoud-Darwish) 
(1941-2008) a Palestinian poet, writer and journalist. 

>  The Mahmoud Darwish Museum is an exquisite edifice befitting the commemoration of the poet and his 
achievements. It seeks to safeguard  Darwish's  cultural, literary and intellectual legacy, and promote his 
noble values: the love he had for his homeland, deep respect for human dignity, and his utter veneration of life. 
His work is the chronicle of a people’s struggle for survival, written with eloquence and profound aestheticism. 
He exalted the value of innovation and openness to world cultures. Through his engagement with existential 
questions, he became indisputably one of the most significance icons of contemporary humanitarian culture. 
Mahmoud Darwish left a rich legacy, a large body of literary works, primarily in the fields of poetry (twenty six volumes) 
and of prose (eleven volumes), most of which have been translated in over twenty two languages. He was recognized 
and acclaimed as Palestinian poet laureate and was celebrated and honored locally, regionally, and internationally, 
receiving numerous prestigious awards, medals and citations. [^1]


The website is still being developed so the content is still sparse, but it will be interesting to come back to it in a 
few months and see the changes they have made. 

In the museum tab you can find the [‘About’](http://mahmouddarwish.ps/en/article/6/About-the-museum) section, 
the [‘Gift shop’](http://mahmouddarwish.ps/en/category/5/4/GIFTSHOP), a small [virtual tour of the space](http://mahmouddarwish.ps/en/article/66/3D-Museum-Video) which still has to be translated in English, and my favorite part of the website, an interesting and informative 3D Museum Video:

As the website is still a trail version, everyone is welcomed to send their suggestions on how they could improve it. 
Some of the elements that, for me, could be upgraded or added are:
- the **biography of the author** which is extremely detailed and, in my opinion, too long to appeal to the general public. 
I think that the text should be shorter, separated in paragraphs, each paragraph should have a bold title and direct quotes 
should be separated from the text and in italic. This would make the page easier to read. 
- a **collection webpage** where they could upload and display pictures or scans of the museum’s artifacts, combined with a brief description.
- the use of hyperlink within texts would bring more traffic to other pages and help the user to navigate better. For example, 
in the [‘About page’](http://mahmouddarwish.ps/en/article/6/About-the-museum), it would be useful to add a direct 
link to [Darwish’s biography](http://mahmouddarwish.ps/en/article/80000160/Mahmoud-Darwish).
- adopt https protocol, as the website now appears unsafe.
