# About me 

Hello everyone!

I'm Silvia, from Venice, Italy but currently living in London! I did my undergrad in Cultural Tourism Planning and Management at the University of Padua, and then worked as an intern in the marketing department of a digital tour operator. 
        
I love traveling and visiting museums, my favorites are the Doge's Palace in Venice and the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. 
        
Looking forward to meeting you all!
