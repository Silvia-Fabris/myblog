[Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com) is a project that was initially launched by Google in 2011 as *Google Art Project*. It is an online archive that contains high definition images of artworks belonging to museum’s from all over the world. It also provides a virtual tour of the galleries where the works of art are exposed. 

You can explore the museums through Google Street View, and artworks are captured in high quality and extreme detail thanks to a new photographic camera invented in 2016 called **Art Camera**, which has a resolution of 7 gigapixel. 

The online collection is made for everyone: from researches to curios visitors who would like to browse museum’s collections. Visitors do not need to have any previous knowledge on the topic, the website will provide suggestions on elements you might like to view and know more about. I believe visitors are expected to look up a particular artwork or museum, but could also choose to look a particular [theme](https://artsandculture.google.com/project). They are expected to feel inspired and I believe also surprised by the quantity of information provided: the website is extremely interactive and besides artworks and virtual tours, you can also find small videos, podcast suggestions, expositions, blog articles, puzzles.

The most interesting features I found while exploring the website are: 
- the **[‘near you’](https://artsandculture.google.com/nearby)** section where you can discover museums that are geographically close to your current or desired location.
- the **hyperlinks** used to keep visitors on the platform and intrigue them by taking them to pages of other attractions

You can search the [collection](https://artsandculture.google.com/partner):

- alphabetically
- geographically
- or randomly by looking at the “All” category

The **metadata** varied according to the artwork and museum they belonged to, but the most popular are:

1. Title
2. Author
3. Date
4. Location
5. Style
6. Provenance
7. Original title
8. Dimension
9. Type
10. External link
11. Material

One of my favorite parts of the website was the [Macchu Picchu virtual tour](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/mAWxq7mCQ7kNKw), where you can see learn its history and see *5 Spectacular Views of Machu Picchu*. 

I also enjoyed watching all the details of one of my favorite paintings *The Starry Night by Van Gogh* of which Google Arts & Culture created a focus titled [Zoom Van Gogh’s ‘The Starry Night’](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/egVRmbCQ5tyrVA)
